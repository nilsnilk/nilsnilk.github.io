The user would push a button which left a trail behind them on the map when they moved. We wanted the user to be able to change color and thickness of the trail. Lastly, we wanted that other users could see the drawings on their devices as they were made in real-time.`}</p>\n    <p>{`In order to do this we first decided to create a client for IOS with Swift and a server built with Node.js, MongoDB, Mongoose and socket.io. Even though the server was ready to go we decided to scrap the real-time solution; we determined that we didn't have the time needed in order to implement the sockets on the client-side. In the end we ended up with a solution where the user can choose whether they want to upload the drawing or not. In the socket.io-based solution required the client to continually send its position to the server. The solution we settled with only needed to post the drawing once to the database, which was fairly easy to implement with MongoDB and Mongoose. `}</p>\n    <h3>{`Role`}</h3>\n    <p>{`Developer, Front End Designer`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Gallery`}</h3>\n    <p><img parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"src\": \"mapdraw.png\",\n        \"alt\": \"Image of user interface\"\n      }}></img>{`\n`}<em parentName=\"p\">{`User interface of the final prototype, with drawings visible on the screen.
